The DURSA includes terms that most every health system, technology vendor, and health information organization under HIPAA are subject to follow if they wish to share electronic health information.

These entities agree on twelve different parts of the contract including; how participants actively engage in Health Information Exchange, privacy and security obligations, permitted purposes of requests for information, future uses of data received from participants, breach notifications and allocation of risk. 

Many organizations use the terms of this contract as the framework for their agreements. Therefore changes or amendments to the DURSA have a rippling effect of all of their institutions needing to make changes to their contracts. The amendment process proposes two needs tool like GitHub. The first is collaboration from all stakeholders to achieve consensus, GitHub could be a public forum where stakeholders could make changes to terms, and proposed amendments could be posted publicly as pull requests. The second is a functionality of version control, for the DURSA and for the contracts that use its term as a framework.
